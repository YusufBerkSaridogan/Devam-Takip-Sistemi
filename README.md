#Attendance Tracking System
A program that checks the continuity of staff in a company.

In this project, personnel log in to the system and start working. Personnel have the right to request leave, provided that it is once a day. When the personnel are on leave, they appear on leave in the system and their working hours are recorded in the system as 0. However, they can work for a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 10 hours. If a staff member works less than necessary, the system gives a warning to return to work. Indicates the time the employee completes his remaining hours and works again. If he does not specify the working time and exits, the working time is considered 0. There is no hour limit for administrators. They can log in and out whenever they want. They can also perform the process of recruiting and removing personnel. In addition to these, they can also examine the table showing the information of the personnel, their attendance status and how many hours they have worked. The Board, on the other hand, has the authority to add, remove and review manager information for managers.
